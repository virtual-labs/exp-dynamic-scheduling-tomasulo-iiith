      "question": "After using the simulator, what did you observe about the register alias table when multiple instructions write to the same register?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The system generates an error message",
        "b": "Only the first instruction proceeds",
        "c": "Each instruction gets assigned a different reservation station tag",
        "d": "All instructions stall until resolved"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The Tomasulo algorithm handles this situation transparently.",
        "b": "Incorrect. All instructions can proceed thanks to register renaming.",
        "c": "Correct. Register renaming assigns different reservation station tags to eliminate false dependencies (WAW hazards).",
        "d": "Incorrect. Register renaming prevents stalling in this situation."

      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "difficulty": "beginner"

    {
      "question": "Based on your simulation experience, what happens when an instruction's operands become available?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The instruction immediately completes execution",
        "b": "The instruction becomes ready and can begin execution when a functional unit is free",
        "c": "The instruction is removed from the reservation station",
        "d": "The instruction broadcasts its result on the CDB"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The instruction still needs time to execute.",
        "b": "Correct. When operands are ready, the instruction becomes eligible for execution but must wait for an available functional unit.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The instruction stays in the reservation station until completion.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Broadcasting happens after execution completes."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },
    {
      "question": "In the simulation, what visual indicator shows that an instruction is waiting for operands?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The instruction appears in red color",
        "b": "Reservation station tags appear in the Qj/Qk fields instead of values",
        "c": "The instruction shows 'BLOCKED' status",
        "d": "The functional unit indicator blinks"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Color coding is not the primary indicator.",
        "b": "Correct. When operands are not ready, the reservation station shows tags (like 'Add1', 'Mul2') in the Qj/Qk fields instead of actual values.",
        "c": "Incorrect. There is no 'BLOCKED' status display.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Functional units don't use blinking indicators."

      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },
    {
      "question": "From your simulation experience, what did you observe about instruction completion order?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Instructions always complete in program order",
        "b": "Instructions complete in reverse program order",
        "c": "Instructions complete out-of-order based on operand availability and execution time",
        "d": "Instruction completion order is random"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This would be in-order execution, not the Tomasulo algorithm.",
        "b": "Incorrect. There's no systematic reverse ordering.",
        "c": "Correct. Instructions complete as soon as their execution finishes, which depends on operand availability and execution latency, resulting in out-of-order completion.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The completion order follows logical rules based on dependencies and timing."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },
    {
      "question": "What performance metric did you notice improved most with the Tomasulo algorithm?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Individual instruction execution time",
        "b": "Memory access latency",
        "c": "Overall instruction throughput (IPC - Instructions Per Cycle)",
        "d": "Cache hit rate"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Individual instruction latencies remain the same.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Memory latency is not directly affected by instruction scheduling.",
        "c": "Correct. The Tomasulo algorithm improves instruction throughput by enabling parallel execution of independent instructions, increasing IPC.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Cache performance is independent of instruction scheduling."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },
    {
      "question": "During simulation, when did you observe the Common Data Bus (CDB) being most active?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "When instructions are being issued to reservation stations",
        "b": "When multiple instructions complete execution simultaneously",
        "c": "When the processor is idle",
        "d": "When instructions are waiting for operands"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Issuing instructions doesn't cause CDB activity.",
        "b": "Correct. The CDB broadcasts results when instructions complete execution, so it's most active when multiple instructions finish around the same time.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Idle processors generate no CDB activity.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Waiting for operands doesn't generate CDB broadcasts."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did you observe about reservation station utilization during long dependency chains?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Reservation stations remain mostly empty",
        "b": "Only one type of reservation station is used",
        "c": "Reservation stations fill up with waiting instructions",
        "d": "Reservation stations are bypassed entirely"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Long dependency chains cause instructions to queue up.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Different instruction types use different reservation station types.",
        "c": "Correct. When instructions depend on previous results, they accumulate in reservation stations waiting for their operands, leading to higher utilization.",
        "d": "Incorrect. All instructions must go through reservation stations in the Tomasulo algorithm."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },
    {
      "question": "After experimenting with the simulator, which factor most significantly limits instruction-level parallelism?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Number of reservation stations available",
        "b": "True data dependencies (RAW hazards) between instructions",
        "c": "Speed of the Common Data Bus",
        "d": "Complexity of the register renaming hardware"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. While limited stations cause structural hazards, they're not the primary ILP limitation.",
        "b": "Correct. True data dependencies create unavoidable sequential constraints that fundamentally limit how many instructions can execute in parallel.",
        "c": "Incorrect. CDB speed is typically not the primary bottleneck.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Register renaming enables parallelism rather than limiting it."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "advanced"
    },
    {
      "question": "Based on your simulation analysis, what would be the most effective way to improve performance in a workload with frequent structural hazards?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Increase the number of reservation stations",
        "b": "Reduce instruction execution latencies",
        "c": "Improve branch prediction accuracy",
        "d": "Increase memory bandwidth"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Structural hazards occur when hardware resources (like reservation stations) are insufficient. Adding more reservation stations directly addresses this bottleneck.",
        "b": "Incorrect. While helpful for overall performance, this doesn't address structural hazards specifically.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Branch prediction doesn't solve resource availability issues.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Memory bandwidth doesn't affect reservation station availability."
